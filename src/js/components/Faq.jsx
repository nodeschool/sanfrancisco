            What actually happens at a NodeSchool SF event?
          </h4>
        </dt>
        <dd className="faq__answer">
          NodeSchool SF events are an opportunity to hang out with other
          learners and mentors in a low stress, encouraging environment. Instead
          of the usual follow-along, presentation-driven workshops, learners can
          either work on self-paced{" "}
          <a href="https://nodeschool.io/">workshoppers</a> or hack on their own
          side projects. There is not a structured ‚Äúcurriculum‚Äù which must be
          followed.
          <br />
          <br />A typical event follows this schedule:
          <ul className="schedule">
            <li className="schedule__item">
              <strong>1:00</strong> - Doors open
            </li>
            <li className="schedule__item">
              <strong>1:15</strong> - Introduction and opening announcements
            </li>
            <li className="schedule__item">
              <strong>1:30-5:00</strong> - Learning/mentoring
            </li>
            <li className="schedule__item">
              <strong>3:00ish</strong> - Pizza! üçï
            </li>
            <li className="schedule__item">
              <strong>5:00</strong> - Event ends
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt className="faq__question">
          <h4 className="faq__subheading">What is a Focused Session?</h4>
        </dt>
        <dd className="faq__answer">
          Focused Sessions happen during our NodeSchool events. While our
          general event is free-form and self-directed, our Focused Sessions are
          more of a lecture-style format led by a mentor on special topics. We
          don&apos;t always have Focused Sessions, so keep an eye on our website
          and Twitter for announcements!
