      <p>
        <strong>NodeSchool SF</strong> is dedicated to providing a
        harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
        gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
        physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack
        thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event
        participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
        for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and
        other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be
        sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event
        organisers.
