# NodeSchool SF

Welcome to the NodeSchool San Francisco chapter's repository. We use this
repository for our website and almost all our communication.

You can see the website here: http://nodeschool.io/sanfrancisco/


## Talk to us

We utilize [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nodeschool/sanfrancisco/issues)
like a message board and keep almost all of our communication in the open. If
for any reason you need to contact an organizer privately you may contact us

## Contributing to the website

The website is static HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It runs on [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Running locally

When you're editing the website it's convenient to run the website locally to
see your changes.

Make sure you install dependencies via:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then you can run the website via:

```bash
$ npm start

[BS] Access URLs:
 --------------------------------------
       Local: http://localhost:3000
    External: http://192.168.43.82:3000

[BS] Serving files from: ./dist
```

Your default browser will automatically open and will auto-reload for any change.

By default it will start the server on port `3000`. If you want to specify a
different port use:

```bash
$ PORT=3000 npm start
```

Where `3000` is any port you choose.

### Performing a build

If you just need to build the application for prodution you can use `npm run build`. This will compile handlebars templates and move them in the `dist` folder.
