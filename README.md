# NodeSchool SF

Welcome to the NodeSchool San Francisco chapter's repository. We use this
repository for our website and almost all our communication.

You can see the website here: http://nodeschool.io/sanfrancisco/


## Talk to us

We utilize [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nodeschool/sanfrancisco/issues)
like a message board and keep almost all of our communication in the open. If
for any reason you need to contact an organizer privately you may contact us
directly.

## Contributing to the website

The website is generated using Mustache templates, Stylus, and JavaScript. It runs on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

#### Running locally

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork to a local folder: `git clone <fork url here>`
3. `cd` into your project folder.
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

For a development server, run

```bash
$ npm run docs:dev
```

Now you can visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to see the website. 

**Important**: edit files inside the directory `docs-src`. Files are compiled into the `docs` folder. Changes will be compiled automatically by the `npm run docs:dev` command.
