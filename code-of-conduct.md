# NodeSchool San Francisco Code of Conduct

We, the organizers of **NodeSchool San Francisco**, are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the organizers of **NodeSchool San Francisco**.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any events at **NodeSchool San Francisco** meetups or in any related communication channels. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the organizers of **NodeSchool San Francisco** may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.

The organizers of the above communities developed this Code of Conduct to govern their respective events and communication channels. We used [PDX Python's anti-harassment policy](http://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/pages/Code_of_Conduct/) and the [Geek Feminism Conference anti-harassment policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) as a starting point.
