# Volunteering for Tasks

Tasks for the website refresh project are listed as issues with the `website-refresh` label in the [NodeSchool SF repo on GitHub](https://github.com/nodeschool/sanfrancisco/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awebsite-refresh). Unassigned tasks will also have the label `help-wanted`, and are up for grabs.

To volunteer for an unassigned task, please leave a comment in the corresponding issue. An organizer will add you as a collaborator to the project. Please accept the collaborator status, and you will be assigned the issue.

If you think something needs doing, but there is no corresponding issue for it, please create an issue so we can organize and evaluate.

# The Build System

**TODO:** describe the build system for contributors once we have one

# Pull Requests

Pull requests should be made against the `new site` branch on the [nodeschool/sanfrancisco repository](https://github.com/nodeschool/sanfrancisco). All collaborators are welcome to review pull requests and submit constructive feedback. Leaving a thumbs-up reaction or the comment "LGTM" (looks good to me) signals approval for merge. The project organizer will merge approved PRs.

# Even More Information

We are refreshing the website in response to attendee feedback that not enough information is being provided prior to events, as well as a need to centralize how event information is updated for upcoming events. For more backstory, see:

- [2017 improvements goals](https://github.com/nodeschool/sanfrancisco/issues/171)
- [NodeSchool SF 2016 Summer Survey](https://github.com/nodeschool/sanfrancisco/issues/165)

# Conduct

Contributors to this project are expected to abide by the [NodeSchool Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodeschool/sanfrancisco/blob/gh-pages/code-of-conduct.md) in all interactions. To that end, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristics.

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude. Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values and circumstances.

Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean, or harass anyone. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact us via DM at [@nodeschoolsf](https://twitter.com/nodeschoolsf) or email us at nodeschoolsf@gmail.com. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.

Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

# Communication

GitHub issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed
changes to this project.

To ask questions or seek guidance in private, please DM [@nodeschoolsf](https://twitter.com/nodeschoolsf) or email nodeschoolsf@gmail.com.

In both contexts, please follow the conduct guidelines above.
